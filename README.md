## Studio Ghibli API tutorial

This site will get data from the Studio Ghibli API and display the titles
and descriptions in a grid.

I am using this to learn more about working with APIs using a tutorial by
Tania Rascia (https://taniarascia.com).

The tutorial is at https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/
