## Studio Ghibli API tutorial

This site will get data from the Studio Ghibli API and display the titles
and descriptions in a grid.

I am using this to learn more about working with APIs using a tutorial by
Tania Rascia (https://taniarascia.com).

The tutorial is at https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/

Since the time the tutorial was created, the original host platform, heroku, has started charging
and it appears that the link https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/ has become inactive. I did some searching and found another link on heroku that is active and will be attempting the tutorial using this: https://studio-ghibli-films-api.herokuapp.com/.

The API endpoint for films is https://studio-ghibli-films-api.herokuapp.com/api/[film name].
